# MSDS 610 Final Project
# Topic: EDA - Common Data Visualization Tools
#### *By Joy Huang and Nhi Nguyen*
Data visualization is an important part of EDA. In this project, we would like to introduce two common data visualization tools: Plotly.js library and Tableau.
1. Plotly.js

Plotly.js is a charting library that comes with over 40 chart types, 3D charts, statistical graphs, and SVG maps. For demonstration, we used Plotly.js to build a dashboard with interactive charts with a dataset obtained from our classmates' survey responses (survey.json). Upon selection of an ID number in a pull down list, a dashboard with the following visualizations will be displayed:
- A general information panel with the selected survey participant's information:
  - Name
  - Hometown
  - Whether or not they have a pet
  - They are a morning or night person?
  - Favorite color
- A horizontal bar chart displaying the participant's top 5 favorite dishes in descending order. The bars' color is the participant's favorite color.
- A gauge chart displaying the selected participant's weekly exercise frequency's value as a measure from 0-7 on the progress bar.
- The dashboard can be accessed via this link: [MSDS 610 Interactive Dashboard](https://nhipqnguyen.github.io/MSDS_610_Final_Project/). Below is a screenshot of the dashboard after getting deployed to Git Pages.
